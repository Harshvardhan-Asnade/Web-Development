        <strong>Iron Man</strong> (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, artist Don Heck, and developed by Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in <i>Tales of Suspense #39</i> (cover dated March 1963).<br /><br />

        Tony Stark is a wealthy industrialist and genius inventor. After suffering a severe chest injury during a kidnapping, Stark is forced to build a suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity.
