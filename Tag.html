    <p>Averages help us find a central value in a group of numbers. They make it easier to compare different sets of data and understand trends.
<br>
        The mean is the most common type of average. It is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the total count.
        <br>
        Another type is the median, which is the middle value in an ordered list. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
        <br>
        The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a set. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes, or no mode at all.
        <br>
        Averages are useful in many areas, including business, science, and daily life. They help people make informed decisions based on numerical data.</p>
